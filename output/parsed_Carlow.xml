<P>CARLOW UNIVERSITY VISION </P>

<P>Carlow University will be a preeminent innovative Catholic university renowned for providing transformation all earning experiences in which students realize their full potential and become career ready ethical leaders committed to a just and merciful world </P>

<P>CARLOW UNIVERSITY MISSION </P>

<P>Carlow University rooted in its Catholic identity and embodying the heritage and values of the Sisters of Mercy offers transformation al educational opportunities for a diverse community of learners empowering them to excel in their chosen work as compassionate responsible leaders in the creation of a just and merciful world </P>

<P>VALUES </P>

<P>MERCY </P>

<P>The identifying value of Carlow University is Mercy encompassing all that we are and do as a university Inspired by our God of Mercy this value urges us to open our hearts to our students our colleagues and our world In the tradition of action and contemplation we seek practical ways of addressing need as we engage in reflection to understand and integrate our experiences Education offers us the tools to recognize and address unjust structures and dehumanizing situations Each discipline provides a lens through which we can envision our place in our own personal transformation and that of the global community The values of Service Discovery Hospitality and the Sacredness of Creation further expand our understanding of the power of Mercy to change our world. </P>

<P>HOSPITALITY </P>

<P>In Hospitality we welcome the wholeness of each person creating a space in our campus community for all individuals with their varied beliefs cultures orientations and abilities Openness to the gifts and perspectives of all creates a community rich in diversity and committed to inclusion </P>

<P>SERVICE </P>

<P>The value of Service calls us beyond ourselves to place the needs of others over our own self interest Our efforts to identify and respond to the needs we see around us lead us to interact with persons andinstitutions in ways that are transformation al Our spirit of compassion leads us to practical action on behalf of those in need </P>

<P>DISCOVERY </P>

<P>Through Discovery we open ourselves to the totality of our human experience to the educational enterprise to our relationship with the Divine and to the wonders of the world in which we find ourselves Discovery energizes our intellectual curiosity and desire for learning It leads us ever deeper in the engagement with our chosen discipline and engenders a spirit of a we at the complexity and variety of creation. </P>

<P>SACREDNESS OF CREATION </P>

<P>This value leads us to a respect for each person and for all of creation Ingratitude for the beauty and variety of our world and its inhabitants we commit to a culture of sustainability and to the preservation of a world where all are reverenced and all may thrive </P>

<P>PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT </P>

<P>The philosophy of Carlow University is guided by a commitment to the Catholic Intellectual Tradition a belief in the transformative power of the liberal arts and a dedication to undergraduate and graduate education that instills social responsibility and a desire to work for the good of all humankind These ideals are touchstones of a Carlow education informing the institution s mission and values so that students can realize their full potential and become ethical leaders in their personal and professional lives committed to a just and merciful world </P>

<P>Rooted in the Catholic Intellectual Tradition Carlow University recognizes the dignity of all human persons and the value of all creation and understands that genuine wisdom and knowledge yield imperatives for justice As a result the institution seeks to graduate individuals who become engaged citizens of the world capable of establishing transformative relationships of compassion and empathy The love of learning and the desire for God are understood to manifest themselves in the relationship between reason and faith Catholic Intellectual Tradition posits that truth is not divided that truth in science is not at odds with truth in religion thus at Carlow truth is explored through a both and an a logical rather than an either or dialectical approach Understanding that no single academic discipline contains all truth Carlow University promotes an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach to research and scholarship believing that creative imaginative attentiveness to the world requires applying complex methods of interpreting that world </P>

<P>This attentiveness to the world is also evident in the university s belief in the transformative power of the liberal arts Derived from the Latin word liber for free the liberal arts have been the foundation of higher education for centuries because they free individuals to think clearly and creatively about themselves and the world in which they live Carlow is committed to the liberal arts as part of its undertaking to educate the whole person body mind and spirit Fundamentally the liberal arts focus on what it means to be human in all humanity s complexity Rather than approaching human experience from a finite perspective or insisting on rigid viewpoints that inhibit knowledge or limit thinking the liberal arts encourage intellectual exploration and often pose problems that have no easy solutions When students engage with the essential issues explored in the liberal arts their lives are transformed and they leave the institution ready to help transform society through their ability to comprehend and address the complex challenges of the world </P>

<P>A commitment to transforming the world flows from the values of the founders of Carlow University When the Sisters of Mercy launched Mount Mercy College in 1929 they were pioneers for women s higher education by combining scholarship in the liberal arts with career development in the professions thus providing young women in the Pittsburgh area equal educational opportunities with men </P>

<P>The Sisters of Mercy were inspired by their founder Catherine McAuley whose social reform efforts recognized the inherent dignity of women and helped those women become self directing and self sustaining As Carlow began to admit male veterans after WorldWar II it was clear that an educational approach that values women is beneficial to both male and female students Such an approach champions the inherent worth of all voices, creating a pedagogical and scholarly environment that includes those who have been historically excluded The Mercy approach to teaching and scholarship which emphasizes inclusion flexibility and collaboration creates a campus culture where men and women experience empathy and mutual respect In practice the university s philosophy leads to undergraduate and graduate pedagogy and curricula rooted in social justice requiring Carlow students and graduates to challenge or affirm prevailing values in the workplace and the world Through coursework research internships and residencies Carlow students embody the integrative Mercy approach to rigorous scholarship creative thinking and problem solving Through the innovative liberal art score experience undergraduate students develop creative and critical reasoning skills essential to any professional vocational or personal situation The original vision of the founders uniquely positions Carlow University today to offer an educational experience in which its graduates seek integrity in their lives and have the skills and conviction to create a more just and merciful world </P>

<P>The United States Department of Education requires that institutions of higher education set standards to measure satisfactory academic progress for students who are receiving Title IV Federal financial aid Carlow uses the same standards to measure academic progress for institutional need based grants The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency PHE A A has its own academic progress policy for Pennsylvania state grant recipients </P>

<P>Satisfactory Progress </P>

<P>Satisfactory progress is defined as a cumulative GPA of atleast 2 0 and enough cumulative credits earned to equal atleast 67 percent of cumulative credits attempted </P>

<P>Students must be able to complete their program of study within 150 percent of the credits required so for a 120 credit bachelor s degree program a first time student must be able to earn the degree within 180 credits attempted in order to remain eligible for Title IV aid </P>

<P>PROCEDURE </P>

<P>The Financial Aid Office reviews academic progress after each semester Transcripts from the Office of the Registrar are reviewed The review includes an examination of the student s cumulative GPA the ratio of credits earned versus credits attempted and the amount of time taken to complete the program of study </P>

<P>Warning: </P>

<P>If a student s cumulative GPA has fallen below 2 0 or the student has earned less than 67 percent of his or her cumulative credits attempted or both the student will be placed on financial aid warning for the following semester Students are notified in writing from the Financial Aid Office of their warning status During this warning period students must work to raise their cumulative GPA to atleast a 2 0 and their cumulative credits earned to atleast 67 percent of cumulative credits attempted Students are strongly encouraged to utilize the tutoring opportunities in the university s Center for Academic Achievement particularly during warning periods Students may continue to receive financial aid during warning periods as long as all other eligibility criteria are met </P>

<P>Suspension: </P>

<P>At the end of the warning period the Financial Aid Office will review the student s academic transcript If the student has not met the minimum criteria for GPA and credits earned eligibility for federal and institutional financial aid will be suspended. Students are notified in writing from the Financial Aid Office of their suspension status The letter will include information about how to appeal due to extenuating circumstances A student s financial aid will not be suspended without a period of warning Students whose financial aid eligibility is suspended may regain eligibility once they meet the requirements for satisfactory academic progress </P>

<P>Appeal Process </P>

<P>If the student s financial aid eligibility is suspended the student may appeal for one additional semester of eligibility as long as there are extenuating circumstances and an academic plan has been established with the student s advisor Extenuating circumstances maybe directly related to the student s academic experience or to circumstances of a more personal nature such as injury illness or trauma All appeals are reviewed by the Academic Progress Committee When an appeal is approved the student will be placed on financial aid probation for the next period of enrollment and will be eligible for financial aid, as long as all other eligibility criteria are met. </P>

<P>The Academic Progress Appeal Form for Financial Aid is located on my Portal under Student HUB and Financial Aid Upon completion the form should be faxed mailed or emailed to the Financial Aid Office to the attention of the Director of Financial Aid All decisions rendered by the committee are final </P>

<P>Scholarship renewal is contingent on GPA Appeals are not considered for students who lose scholarship eligibility because their GPA is below required minimum </P>

<P>Transfer Students </P>

<P>Credit hours accepted at Carlow are counted as both attempted and completed hours </P>

<P>Withdrawals: </P>

<P>A WD is assigned if a student officially withdraws from a particular course prior to the finaldate to withdraw in a given semester according to the academic calendar published in the Carlow Course Schedule and online at www carlow edu registrar registrar html AWD on a transcript influences the ratio of cumulative credits earned versus credits attempted Withdrawals also impact the amount of time taken to complete the program of study </P>

<P>Repeated Courses: </P>

<P>A student wishing to retake a course in which they received a DorF grade can do so only by repeating the same course at Carlow University Both grades for a repeated course are recorded on the transcript The higher grade is used in the calculation of the cumulative GPA A student who repeats a course one time may still be considered for financial aid for that course A student who repeats a course for which credits were earned will not earn additional credits for the repeated course </P>

<P>Academic Forgiveness </P>

<P>When a student is granted Academic Forgiveness by the provost the actual earned credits and earned grade are the units taken into account for the purpose of measuring academic progress for financial aid </P>

<P>Pennsylvania State Grants </P>

<P>For each academic year during which a Pennsylvania state grant is received a student must successfully complete the minimum number of credits appropriate to the student s enrollment status during the semester s for which state grant aid was received In an academic year students receiving two full time semesters of state grant aid must earn atleast 24 credits and students receiving two part time semesters of state grant aid must earn atleast 12 credits A student who has not maintained satisfactory academic progress for state grant aid may enroll in summer courses without state grant aid to makeup the necessary credits </P>

<P>LEARNING ASSESSMENT AT CARLOW </P>

<P>A Carlow degree represents a commitment to our students a commitment that they will be given the opportunity to learn and be able to demonstrate the skills knowledge and competencies that are necessary to enter into a career a community of practice or higher levels of graduate study One of the ways we honor this commitment is through the practice of learning assessment By engaging in learning assessment processes we take steps to ensure our students achieve the learning goals represented by their degree </P>

<P>Through our learning assessment efforts we seek to provide truthful and accurate answers to the following questions: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>What goals do we have for students with respect to the knowledge competencies and skills they should develop or master to be able to enter into a career a community of practice or higher levels of graduate study </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>What intentional steps do we take to achieve these goals </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>How successful are our students in achieving these goals That is what are the actual outcomes </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>How do we improve student learning when the information obtained through our efforts indicates that students’ progress in achieving these goals is not sufficient </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>In Standards for Accreditation and Requirements of Affiliation 2016 the Middle States Commission on Higher Education observes that assessment has the student as its primary focus functions to help students improve their learning enhances quality and leads to continuous improvements in academic programs </P>

<P>As a member of the Middle States Association Carlow University embraces these principles as integral to its own framework for assessment. In fact, the improvement of teaching and learning is the framework s primary goal </P>

<P>Carlow s Learning Assessment Framework </P>

<P>Based on best practices in the field of learning assessment we have established a common set of expectations for the development and assessment of student learning outcomes Each program of study is responsible for maintaining a sustainable assessment process Specifically a sustainable assessment plan in Carlow s learning assessment framework includes the following elements </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Clearly Articulated Student Learning Outcomes To ensure learning a program must first define goals in order to intentionally work toward those goals With this in mind each program of study defines five to seven program level student learning outcomes These outcomes are statements about what a learner should be able to do after he she has completed the program of study At the end of each academic year departments and programs of study review their outcome results and use the information to determine action steps that will improve bolster and better assure student learning </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Defined Measures and Criteria for Success Learning outcome statements specify student learning behaviors that are observable measurable and able to be demonstrated Based on all of this each program of study identifies opportunities where students apply and demonstrate their learning outcomes These can include exams papers presentations projects and other assignments After identifying these demonstration opportunities programs of study establish standards of quality i e criteria for success that they will use to evaluate the learning outcomes ensuring that they meet our expectations and prepare students for future success Wherever necessary rubrics are developed to clearly explain the criteria used to evaluate outcomes. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Collection and Analysis of Data Upon conducting assessments of each learning outcome programs of study and Compass curriculum areas collect and analyze the resulting data This analysis includes evaluation of the achievement of each outcome and thus leads to identification of best practices or areas in which student learning can be improved </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Action Plans for the Improvement of Student Learning Where data collected indicate unsatisfactory progress in the achievement of learning outcomes faculty will identify tangible actions that will betaken to improve student learning The efficacy of these actions is then evaluated through future assessments </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>It should be noted that while this framework provides clear guidelines for how each program of study carries out assessment it leaves great flexibility to faculty departments and programs in determining and implementing the best practices for evaluating their students achievement There are several programs at Carlow University that are externally accredited including programs in the School of Nursing CC NE the Counseling Psychology Doctoral Program APA the Respiratory Care Program provisional accreditation through the Council on Accreditation for Respiratory Care CO ARC and the Social Work program CS WE For these programs external agencies often have their own requirements regarding assessment and these programs may adapt the Carlow framework to conduct assessment of student learning in ways that align with those requirements </P>

<P>Assessment Reports and Activities </P>

<P>Each program produces an assessment report each year that includes the following </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Assessment results data from the mostrecent academic year </LBody>

<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Plans for the improvement of student learning that result from analysis of the data collected </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Additionally general education and institutional learning outcomes a k a Compass learning outcomes are reviewed by the Carlow Compass Curriculum Steering Committee In these reviews which are designed to carefully examine the quality of education achieved by our Carlow Compass Curriculum information and data on assessment of student learning are carefully evaluated by representative faculty from across the university </P>

<P>Students have a responsibility to attend classes for which they have registered and fully participate in them Specific attendance requirements for each course are established by the instructor Students should be aware of individual course attendance policies as they are held accountable for meeting those standards Students are obligated to be in attendance on days with examinations major or minor are scheduled Students who absent themselves from examinations maybe refused permission to take the examination at a later date may receive a failing grade for the examination missed and may receive a failing grade for the course Further absence from class on a daywhen an assignment is due does not excuse the student from the obligation to have the assignment turned in on time Faculty may refuse to accept any work which is turned in late and may assign a failing grade for that work. </P>

<P>ACCELERATED COURSES </P>

<P>Accelerated courses regardless of delivery mode have a very specific attendance policy and faculty teaching these courses have a responsibility to adhere to it Students who miss more than the equivalent of two class meetings of an eight week week accelerated course will receive anF failing grade This policy includes partial absences that add up to more than two class meetings </P>

<P>ONLINE DISTANCE EDUCATION COURSES </P>

<P>In an online distance education context documenting that a student has logged into an online class is not sufficient, by itself to demonstrate academic attendance by the student A university must demonstrate that a student participated in class or was otherwise engaged in an academically related activity such as by contributing to an online discussion or initiating contact with a faculty member to aska course related question in order to constitute attendance </P>

<P>STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND ABSENCE FOR MANDATORY UNIVERSITY SPONSORED EVENTS </P>

<P>A university sponsored event is defined as an event directly related to a student s education or the university community that takes place outside the classroom Examples include participation in varsity athletics professional conferences on campus theatre productions and student orientation activities </P>

<P>A student whose participation in a university sponsored event is required such as athletics or would promote her his education such as presenting research at a professional conference must notify the appropriate faculty member s of her his participation in these particular events as well as the anticipated absence from class It is recommended that the student should notify the appropriate faculty member s atleast one week prior to the actual absence and if it is available present the faculty member with a schedule of her his events </P>

<P>The student is responsible for all material and assignments covered during the absence In the event that a student will be absent from an examination or absent on the due date for an assignment the student will be expected to makeup the examination or submit the assignment at a time and place designated by the faculty member All students participating in university sponsored events must be given the opportunity to makeup class work including labs assignments and exams that they miss during attendance at such sponsored events Every effort should be made to accommodate the student and there will be no consequences due to missing class for the events such as point deductions for an assignment loss of attendance points unfavorable grade adjustments or new assignments beyond those listed in the course syllabus </P>

<P>The student should also discuss the event schedule with her his academic advisor when registering for courses To the extent that event schedules are known in advance and to the extent that multiple sections are offered for particular courses the student where it is possible and where it does not adversely affect the integrity of her his Carlow education should schedule courses in such away as to minimize schedule conflicts Accelerated courses are not recommended for students who are aware that they have extensive travel commitments evening obligations or other university sponsored activities that would cause them to miss such classes The guidelines established by the university regarding CAP classes will apply Realizing that circumstances which may cause an absence may vary greatly, any exceptions will beat the discretion of the faculty member on a case by case basis </P>

<P>BACKGROUND </P>

<P>The U S Department of Education at 34 CFR Section 600 2 defines credit hour as </P>

<P>an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institution ally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than </P>

<P>1 one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time or 2 atleast an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph 1 of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work internships pr act ica studio work and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours </P>

<P>The Pennsylvania regulation states in part A semester credit hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty A quarter credit hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 10 hours or classroom instruction plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty.” 22 Pa Code Section 31 21 b u </P>
